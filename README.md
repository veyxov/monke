Extract keywords, literals and identifiers

## Parser
A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds
a data structure â€“ often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other
hierarchical structure â€“ giving a structural representation of the input, checking for
correct syntax in the process. [â€¦] The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical
analyser, which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters;
